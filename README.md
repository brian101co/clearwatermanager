# Clearwater RV Management App
Clearwater RV Management Dashboard is an internal management tool to help park managers manage reservations, track park maintenance through a work order system, and provide park performance metrics.

The reservation management system allows managers to add, view, edit, and cancel reservations. Additionally, the reservation management system allows managers to check site availability for specified check-in and check-out dates to prevent overbooking or double-booking. As reservations near their check-out time, notifications are shown above the reservation tables for convenience.

At a glance, the interactive park map shows managers which sites are currently vacant (green). When selected, each site on the map opens a modal showing the site's information. For example, what size units the site can handle and any relevant additional information.

The work order system allows park managers to manage and track site maintenance easily from a centralized dashboard. Maintenance crews can view the work orders online and mark them as complete when finished. The dashboard tracks the associated maintenance cost over time as work orders are completed on the metrics page, providing park managers with operation costs.
